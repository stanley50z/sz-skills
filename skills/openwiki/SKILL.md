description: Use when the user asks to set up OpenWiki in a repository, update the generated openwiki/ docs, or publish them to the GitHub Wiki — or when work touches the openwiki CLI, an openwiki/ directory, or an OPENWIKI block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.

# OpenWiki

OpenWiki is a CLI that generates and maintains agent-facing repository documentation under `openwiki/` — its **code mode**. Always invoke the `code` subcommand explicitly: bare `openwiki --update` targets the personal-mode wiki in `~/.openwiki/wiki`, which is unrelated to repository work. For CLI capabilities beyond this skill (personal mode, connectors, other providers), read the installed README at `<npm root -g>/openwiki/README.md`.

## Durable decisions

- OpenWiki runs **local-only**, on the saved ChatGPT-subscription login: set `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER` to `openai-chatgpt` for every run. The upstream README recommends a scheduled CI workflow, but that path needs a metered API key, so repositories stay free of OpenWiki CI: delete `.github/workflows/openwiki-update.yml` (or the GitLab equivalent) whenever a run recreates it.
- Generated docs publish to the repository's **native GitHub Wiki**, not MkDocs or GitHub Pages.
- Pages under `openwiki/` change by rerunning OpenWiki, never by hand-editing (unless explicitly asked).

## Where things live

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `openwiki/` in the repo | Generated docs; `quickstart.md` is the entry page; `INSTRUCTIONS.md` is the generation prompt, never published |
| `<!-- OPENWIKI:START/END -->` blocks in `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Rewritten by OpenWiki on each code run; leave their contents to OpenWiki |
| `~/.openwiki/.env` | Provider and model selection plus ChatGPT OAuth tokens |
| `wiki/` in the repo (ignored by the main repo) | Separate git repository backing the GitHub Wiki tab |
| `~/.openwiki/wiki` | Personal-mode wiki — unrelated to repository docs |

Treat every value in `~/.openwiki/.env` as a password, the refresh token above all: if you must inspect the file, read variable names only — never print, copy, or commit a value.

## Update the generated docs

```powershell
$env:OPENWIKI_PROVIDER = 'openai-chatgpt'
openwiki code --update --print
```

Review `git status --short`, `git diff --check`, and `git diff`. A run may touch the `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` blocks or recreate the CI workflow even when the docs are already current.

Done when every touched file is explained by the review and no OpenWiki CI workflow exists in the tree.

## Publish to the GitHub Wiki

The GitHub Wiki is a separate git repository, cloned inside the main repository at `wiki/` (clone missing or wiki not yet created → [references/setup.md](references/setup.md)). Keep `/wiki/` in the main repository's `.gitignore` so the nested Wiki repository never appears in its status. The Wiki **flattens** all pages into one namespace, so publishing is copy + rename + link rewrite.

Before publication, check whether `wiki/` is the Wiki clone. If `wiki/` exists but is not that clone, stop and report the path collision rather than replacing its contents. If `wiki/` is absent but the legacy sibling `../<repo>.wiki` exists, verify that its `origin` is this repository's Wiki, add `/wiki/` to the main repository's `.gitignore`, and move the clone to `wiki/`; leave any mismatched sibling untouched and report it. When neither location has the clone, check whether the `<repo>.wiki.git` remote is available. GitHub creates the Wiki remote only after Wikis are enabled and the first page is saved.

When the remote is unavailable, invoke the `browser-harness` skill and initialize it through GitHub's web UI:

1. Open the repository **Settings** page and enable **Wikis** under **Features**.
2. Open the repository **Wiki** tab, create the first page as `Home`, give it the temporary body `Initializing OpenWiki publication.`, and save it.
3. Verify that `<repo>.wiki.git` now resolves, add `/wiki/` to the main repository's `.gitignore`, clone the Wiki into `wiki/`, and continue publication in the same run.

Use the logged-in browser session according to the browser-harness login rules. Stop only when GitHub requires user-only authentication or confirmation, the authenticated account lacks repository administration permission, or the repository/account plan does not expose Wikis. Report the exact blocker and preserve the generated docs for a later retry. If the saved first page exists but the remote remains unavailable, investigate Wiki enablement, repository access, and Git credentials as separate causes.

Map each source page to a wiki file:

- An existing wiki's pages are the mapping — match each source page to its established wiki page and keep names stable.
- On first publication, `openwiki/quickstart.md` becomes `Home.md`; give every other page a short readable flattened title (`architecture/overview.md` → `Architecture-overview.md`) free of `\ / : * ? " < > |`.
- Every page gets a `_Sidebar.md` entry; the sidebar's source of truth is the clone itself.

Rewrite links in the copied pages for the flattened namespace:

- Internal links → flattened page names without `.md`: `architecture/overview.md` becomes `Architecture-overview`.
- Links to main-repository files → absolute `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<branch>/...` (or `tree/...`) URLs. A relative `../` path cannot reach the main repository from the wiki repo.

Done when every page under `openwiki/` except `INSTRUCTIONS.md` has exactly one wiki page and a sidebar entry, and a search of the clone for `](../` and for relative links ending in `.md)` returns nothing (absolute `https://github.com/...` URLs are exempt).

Validate and push from the clone (the wiki's default branch — the one GitHub renders — is typically `master`):

```powershell
git -C wiki status --short
git -C wiki diff --check
git -C wiki add --all
git -C wiki commit -m "docs: sync OpenWiki pages"
git -C wiki push origin master
```

Done when the clone's local `HEAD`, upstream, and remote branch agree, and the Wiki tab renders `Home` with the sidebar.

## First-time setup

Installing the CLI, the ChatGPT login, initializing a repository's docs, and creating/cloning its GitHub Wiki: [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).
